## About Us
We fight food waste by finding a home for crushed candy. We source it directly from confectioners and deliver it to customers’ doors for 30-50% less than candy store prices. By eating ‘crushed,’ you’re helping build a more sustainable and effective food system. You’re helping fight food waste. You’re ensuring confectioners are rewarded for their full harvest of candy with less wasted sugar, dye, and sugar. With every lick of a crushed candy cane or jolly rancher, you’re helping shape our world for the better.

In a world obsessed with perfection, we’re here to show the beauty in imperfection. We’re here to make a statement that our differences are what make us beautiful. We invite you to join our community and help us build a less wasteful world that’s as beautiful as it is delicious!
